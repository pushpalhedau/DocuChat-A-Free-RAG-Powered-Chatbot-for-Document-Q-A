# DocuChat-A-Free-RAG-Powered-Chatbot-for-Document-Q-A
Developed a RAG-based chatbot using LangChain for document parsing and chunking, enabling semantic search over custom text. Utilized FAISS for vector storage and MiniLM (sentence-transformers) for dense embeddings. Integrated FLAN-T5 from Hugging Face for context-aware responses and deployed the chatbot with Gradio on Google Colab.
